    "# Generate Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Features are generated on a per-play basis to predict the overall defensive coverage scheme.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unless specified as the value at a particular stage of the play (snap, throw, etc.), the features are calculated at each time step between the snap and a \"pivot\" event that will alter the behavior of the defense (i.e. throw or sack) or a maximum elapsed time after the snap, whichever is first. The maximum time is meant to limit the effect of the play breaking down on the planned movements of the players.\n",
    "\n",
    "All defenders are evaluated at a threshold time in the play (e.g. 1.5 seconds after snap) if they are still beyond the line of scrimmage to determine which defenders are actually in coverage vs. blitzing. Blitzing player values would skew average results, and the movement of the rusher does not matter beyond the fact that they are not in coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following features are generated at a per-defender level (inspired by [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.11373)), then averaged across all coverage defenders:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **depth_mean**: average yards downfield of the defender (same as X_mean but normalizes for line of scrimmage)\n",
    "* **depth_var**: variance in downfield movement (same as X_var, lower value expected for zone)\n",
    "* **y_mean**: average horizontal location of defender\n",
    "* **y_var**: variance in horizontal movement (lower value expected for zone)\n",
    "* **speed_mean**: average speed of the defender, yd/sec (lower value expected for zone)\n",
    "* **speed_var**: variance in speed of the defender (lower expected for zone)\n",
    "* **off_mean**: average distance to the closest offensive player at each frame during a play (lower expected for man)\n",
    "* **off_var**: variance in distance to the closest offensive player at each frame (lower expected for man)\n",
    "* **def_mean**: average distance to the closest defender at each frame\n",
    "* **def_var**: variance in distance to the closest defender at each frame\n",
    "* **rat_mean**: see paper for better description\n",
    "* **rat_var**: see paper for better description\n",
    "* **rat_o_los**: ratio of time during a play that a defender is facing the QB/line of scrimmage. Expected to be near 1 for zone (reading the QB's eyes, keeping receivers in front of them vs. turning and running with the receiver) **Current threshold is 180 degrees; may want to make this smaller like 90 degrees to account for man coverage following crossing routes or moving mostly sideways but slightly towards the LOS**\n",
    "\n",
    "The following play-level features are generated:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **n_cover**: the number of defenders with tracking data in coverage (beyond the LOS at t_defender_thresh sec)\n",
    "* **n_cb**: the number of cornerbacks in the defensive formation\n",
    "* **n_def_excess**: the number of coverage defenders minus eligible receivers (players available for zone or double coverage)\n",
    "\n",
    "The following features are evaluated based on player locations at the snap (leverage info when defense do not disguise coverage pre-snap):\n",
    "* **n_deep_snap**: the number of defenders over 10 yards downfield at the snap\n",
    "* **cb_depth_snap_min**: depth of closest CB to the LOS (press vs. soft)\n",
    "* **cb_depth_snap_mean**: average depth of CBs\n",
    "* **cb_depth_snap_max**: depth of farther CB to the LOS (zone expected for far off the ball)\n",
    "\n",
    "The following features are evaluated at the \"freeze\" time (determining which players are in coverage, coverage scheme is assumed to be materialized regardless if it was being disguised pre-snap or not):\n",
    "* **n_deep_frz**: number of defenders over 10 yards downfield at \"freeze\"\n",
    "* **def_spac_frz_avg**: spacing to nearest defender at \"freeze\", averaged over all coverage players\n",
    "* **def_spac_frz_min**: same source as above, but minimum (larger expected for zone)\n",
    "* **def_spac_frz_max**: same source as above, but maximum (smaller expected for zone)\n",
    "* **cb_depth_frz_min**: same as at snap but at the \"freeze\" time\n",
    "* **cb_depth_frz_mean**: same as at snap but at the \"freeze\" time\n",
    "* **cb_depth_frz_max**: same as at snap but at the \"freeze\" time"
